RPG Sessions is the platform for **Star Wars RPG** and **Genesys**. Whether you're playing Edge of the Empire, Age of Rebellion, Force and Destiny, or any Genesys setting, this is where you manage characters, run games, and roll those distinctive narrative dice with your group.

## What You Can Do

RPG Sessions gives you everything you need to play narrative dice games online or at the table:

- **Character Sheets** — Build and manage characters with full support for talents, abilities, force powers, and all the crunch your system requires
- **Vehicle Sheets** — Track starships, speeders, and other craft with dedicated vehicle sheets
- **Game Tables** — Create virtual spaces where you and your players can gather, share characters, and play together
- **Dice Rolling** — Roll narrative dice with automatic symbol calculation, including the full Star Wars and Genesys dice sets
- **Character Imports** — Import characters from popular tools like OggDude's Character Generator and SWCharGen Emporium
- **Discord Integration** — Access your characters and roll dice directly from Discord with our bot
