The `/invite` command allows users to quickly generate an invite link that can be used to add the RPG Sessions bot to other servers. This command is helpful for expanding the availability of the bot to other groups and game servers.

#### Example Usage

- Simply type `/invite` in the server where the bot is available.
- The bot will respond with a link that looks like:
  > Do you want me to join you on another server? [Click here!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=534606682928578572&permissions=309774806080&scope=bot)

Clicking the link will open the invitation page, where users with the proper permissions can add the RPG Sessions bot to their Discord servers.

#### Important Notes

- **Permissions Required**: The user must have permission to add bots to the target server to use the invite link successfully.
- **Use Case**: Great for when you want to introduce the RPG Sessions bot to new campaigns or other groups that are playing tabletop RPGs on Discord.
