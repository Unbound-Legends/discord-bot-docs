## `/game pair`

### Overview

The `/game pair` subcommand allows a Game Master to link a game session to a Discord server or specific channels within a server. This functionality is designed to help manage game sessions across multiple channels or even multiple servers, ensuring that the game is properly integrated into the server where it is being played.

### Command Options

- **`table` (String)**: The name of the game table to pair with this Discord server. This is optional, and if not provided, a new game will be created.
- **`current-channel` (Boolean)**: If set to `true`, the current channel will be linked to the game. This is useful if you want to associate specific channels in a server with different game tables. Defaults to `false`.

### Examples

- `/game pair table:Adventure Campaign` - Pairs the specified game table named "Adventure Campaign" with the current Discord server.
- `/game pair current-channel:true` - Pairs the current channel only to the game.
- `/game pair` - Creates a new game and pairs it with the server.

### Important Notes

- Only users with the **Manage Server** permission are allowed to use this command.
- You need to be the Game Master of a specific game in order to pair it with a Discord server.

### Additional Information

- Pairing a game table with a server or channel ensures that all game-specific features are accessible to the players within those channels.
- This command is useful for managing multiple game sessions in a single Discord server, allowing Game Masters to keep track of where different games are hosted.

## `/game unpair`

### Overview

The `/game unpair` subcommand allows a Game Master or a server administrator to disconnect a game session from the current Discord server or channel. This command is useful for cases where the association between a game and a server or channel is no longer needed, providing flexibility in game management.

### Command Options

This subcommand does not have any additional options. It simply disconnects the game session from the server or channel in which the command is used.

### Examples

- `/game unpair` - Unpairs the game from the current channel or server.

### Important Notes

- Only users with the **Manage Server** permission can use this command to unpair a game.
- If the game is linked to multiple channels within the same server, this command will unpair only the specific channel where it is used. If used without any channels specified, it will unpair the entire server from the game.
- This command should be used cautiously, as unpairing will remove access to game-specific features for users in that server or channel.

## `/game view`

### Overview

The `/game view` subcommand provides details about the currently active game in the server or channel. It helps players and Game Masters keep track of game-specific settings, themes, and other vital information, allowing for better game management and awareness.

### Command Options

- **`all` (Boolean)**: If set to `true`, displays information for all games associated with the current server. Defaults to showing only the active game if not specified.
- **`private` (Boolean)**: If set to `true`, the response will only be visible to the user who invoked the command. Defaults to `true`.

### Examples

- `/game view` - Displays details about the current game linked to the channel or server.

### Important Notes

- This command can be used by both Game Masters and players to get an overview of the game's setup and current state.
- If multiple channels are paired to different games, you can use the `all` option to see every game associated with the server.

### Additional Information

- The `/game view` command displays details like the game theme, the number of players, and any story or destiny points available.
