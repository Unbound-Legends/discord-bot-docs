description: The story command group allows you to view and manage story points for your current game
---

The `/story` command provides a collection of subcommands that handle everything related to story points in your game. Story points are a core mechanic, often used to influence gameplay, either by players or the Game Master (GM). With the `/story` commands, you can view, add, remove, roll, use, and clear destiny points as needed.

The `/story` point commands are identical to the `/destiny` commands, but with `/story` instead of `/destiny`. Please refer to the [destiny documentation](../destiny) for more information.
