:::note[Stub]
This feature page will cover:
- What fog of war does: hides parts of the map from players
- The fog tool (F key): drawing fog polygons
- Erasing fog to reveal areas
- How fog loads before assets (prevents players seeing hidden content during refresh)
- Exploration tracking:
  - Areas revealed by fog erasure are remembered
  - Players see where they've been even if fog is redrawn
- GM controls:
  - Clear exploration: reset what players have seen
  - Fog is GM-only (players cannot draw or erase fog)
- Best practices:
  - Pre-fogging dungeon maps
  - Revealing room by room
  - Using fog for dramatic reveals
- Real-time sync: fog changes are instant for all players
