:::note[Stub]
This feature page will cover:
- What range bands are: visual overlays showing narrative distances
- The 5-ring system:
  - Engaged (innermost, blue) - melee range
  - Short (green) - close combat, thrown weapons
  - Medium (yellow) - typical ranged combat
  - Long (orange) - long-range weapons
  - Extreme (red, outermost) - maximum range
- Default ring multipliers (1.0x, 1.8x, 3.0x, 4.2x from the base short range)
- Showing range bands: select a token to display its range overlay
- Adjusting individual rings by dragging the handles
- How adjusting the first (short) ring scales all other rings proportionally
- Minimum spacing between rings (25px)
- Maximum ring radius (2000px)
- Saving range band configurations (persisted per map page)
- When to use range bands vs grid-based measurement
- Games that use narrative ranges (Genesys, FFG Star Wars) vs tactical grids
