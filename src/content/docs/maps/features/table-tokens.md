description: How Patreon table tokens grant Maps access to your game
---

Table tokens are how RPG Sessions shares Patreon benefits with your entire
game table. When you support us on 
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rpgsessions), you receive a table token (2 if you go Champion tier!) that
you can assign to your game, allowing everyone at that table to have access to 
the same table-level patron-tier features you do.

This means one patron can unlock Maps for their whole group. No need to ask
everyone to subscribe individually.

## Assigning Tokens to Games

To assign a table token to one of your games:

1. Go to your game table on [RPG Sessions](https://rpgsessions.com)
2. Open the table settings
3. Select the token you want to assign from your available tokens
4. Confirm the assignment

Once assigned, everyone at that table immediately gains access to the features that token provides.

## Moving Tokens Between Games

Life happens—campaigns end, groups change, or you might want to try a one-shot with different people. You can move your
table tokens between games, but there's a cooldown to prevent abuse.

**Movement limits:**

- You can move each token up to **2 times** within any 7-day period – 
  effectively allowing you to juggle two games a week per token
- After two moves, you'll need to wait before moving that token again
- Unlinking a token from a game counts as one move

This system gives you flexibility while ensuring tokens stay reasonably stable on active tables.

## Unlinking Tokens

If a campaign ends or you need to reassign a token, you can unlink it from a game table at any time through the table
settings. Remember that unlinking counts toward your movement limit for that token.

When a token is unlinked, the table loses access to the premium features that token provided. Players will see standard
access until a new token is assigned.
