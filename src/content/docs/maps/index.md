## Features

Sessions Maps gives you everything you need for tactical gameplay:

- **Real-time Collaboration** — Everyone sees changes instantly. Move a token, draw a line, or reveal an area, and your players see it the moment it happens.
- **Character Integration** — Add tokens linked to your RPG Sessions characters. Tokens display character stats and can show range bands for attacks and abilities.
- **Fog of War** — Control visibility with fog areas that hide parts of the map. As players explore, the fog reveals to show where they've been.
- **Drawing Tools** — Sketch directly on the map to highlight areas, draw paths, or add quick notes during play.
- **Encounters** — GMs can prepare encounters ahead of time and add them to the map during sessions.
- **Asset Management** — Add images, tokens, and environmental objects. Lock assets in place, organize them into layers, and copy/paste across maps.
