Run tactical encounters with real-time collaboration using Sessions Maps. It's a browser-based tool that runs directly on the RPG Sessions website, no installation required. Build interactive battle maps, place tokens linked to your characters, draw directly on the canvas, and manage fog of war, all while your players see every change the moment it happens.

:::note[Patreon Required]
Sessions Maps requires an **Adventurer tier or higher** Patreon subscription, or a game table with an Adventurer-tier [table token](/docs/maps/features/table-tokens) assigned. One patron can unlock Maps for their whole group. [Support us on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rpgsessions) to get started.

## Features

Sessions Maps gives you everything you need for tactical gameplay:

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Every change syncs instantly. Move a token, draw a line, reveal fog — your players see it the moment it happens.
- **[Character Tokens](/docs/maps/features/character-tokens)**: Add tokens linked to your RPG Sessions characters. They display wound and strain bars, character names, and minion group counters, all updating in real-time.
- **[Fog of War](/docs/maps/features/fog-of-war)**: Draw opaque fog areas to hide parts of the map from players. Erase fog room by room as the party explores.
- **[Layers](/docs/maps/features/layers)**: Organize assets across multiple layers with independent visibility, ordering, and locking. Set layers to GM-only for prep work players can't see.
- **[Grid System](/docs/maps/features/grid-system)**: Overlay square or hex grids with snap-to-grid positioning, arrow key movement, and tools for building tiled maps.
- **[Range Bands](/docs/maps/features/range-bands)**: Display colored range band rings around tokens for narrative distance systems like Genesys and FFG Star Wars.
- **[GM Controls](/docs/maps/features/gm-controls)**: Hide and restrict assets, summon players to your view, manage multiple map pages, and add encounters.
- **Drawing Tools**: Sketch directly on the map with the brush tool. Place marker stamps, draw freehand, and use the eraser to clean up.
- **Encounters**: GMs can browse encounters from their RPG Sessions game and add NPCs directly to the map from the asset manager.
