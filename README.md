# RPG Sessions Discord Bot Documentation

Welcome! This is the documentation repository for the RPG Sessions Discord Bot. With this project, we decided to open the repo publicly so the community could contribute tips and tricks to the documentation if they wanted to.

This project is built off of [Astro](https://astro.build/), specifically the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) template. I've left the instructions for the structure and how to run the project below.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
